Online Networking Design Tool

My final year project which would allow students to learn networking concepts and overall be able to create a network topology.
Build network topologies using our modern design and easy to use tool using a variety of devices and link them together using appropriate cable.  Set a subnet mash and supernet mash for your network as well as assigning IP addresses to the devies. Validation can be run against your network to check for incorrect assigned IP address or for the optimal supernet/supernet mash.
